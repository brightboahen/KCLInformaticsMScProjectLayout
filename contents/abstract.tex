\section*{Abstract}
Collaboration, people working together has helped man achieve greater feats.Achievements that would otherwise be unachievable. We see this in team sports, scientific research teams.The school classroom is no different with regards to collaboration. Surveys conducted among pupils in the United Kingdom showed that pupils work best in groups or teams.The single most important tool in a teacher's toolbox and a factor that contributes to grouping of pupils into an efficient and effective collaborative groups or teams is the seating plan. 

In this project we look at theories to effective seating arrangements that encourages collaboration and improves pupil performance in the classroom and apply these theories by implementing a classroom management system that adapts its user interface to suit the needs and preferences of the teacher.
