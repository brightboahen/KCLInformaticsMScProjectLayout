\section*{Abstract}
In recent years,the need for applications to proactively implement such techniques has increased, especially in the Enterprise Software industry where developers strive to develop softwares that are highly efficient and almost completely eradicates the potential of human errors and the costs that come with it. By so doing, users of the software application must all use it the same way, information is presented the same way and must all reason about the information being present in more or less the same manner in order to get any useful result out of using the said application.

In this project we develop a classroom management web application that builds on adaptive user interface techniques and places the emphasis on the user(teacher). This system like other AUI system will try to adapt to the user rather than the user adapting to it. We will also explore the landscape of AUI or IUI techniques that are currently in use and make our contributions.
