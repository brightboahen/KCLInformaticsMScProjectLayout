\section*{Abstract}
The single most important tool in a teacher's toolbox and a factor contributing to a pupils performance in a classroom that is completely under a teacher's control is their seating positions and pairings in the classroom. 

In this project we look at the theories applicable to classroom seating arrangements and apply them to develop a classroom management tool that adapts its user interface and in particular its seating arrangement rules to suit the preferences of the teacher.
